Locators:
What is a locator?
locator is used to identify any webelement on the webpage

in playwright there are different locator strategies available

playwright made life easy to identify any weblement and to interact


getByRole:
how does getByRoleWorks
it works based on acceble name

what it is ?

each webellememt that is available on the webpage have a html struture
in this we have 2 types of HTML tags

1.Paired html
2.Unpaired html


paired html tags?
tags which are having open and close 
<h3>......</h3>

.....--->> innrer text,inner html,text , accessble name


<input 
type="text" 
data-val="true" 
data-val-required="First name is required." 
id="FirstName" 
name="FirstName">


here on unpaired html tags, playwright will serach withere is accesible role available on the element application

then search for name attribute, if available use it else switch to another locator strtegy

getByRole("api",{name:acceblename or name property})



xyz-- testId='opi'

Grouping:--()
when there are more than one element available with the given xpath
if you want to select any specific elementout of it
then we use Grouping

starts-with()
if any attribute of any element, keeping changing except the starting playwright
in such cases we use start-with

using starts with, we can expect, mofre than one element to get identified

For Ex:
id="ABC1234"
id="ABC789"
id="ABC654"
id="ABC*&*"

here ABC is alone constant and rest is getting change

starts-with(@attribute,'value')

starts-with(text(),'starting text')


contains():
if any attribute of any element, keeping changing but some part of the attribute is constant
in such cases we use contains()

using contains, we can expect, mofre than one element to get identified


conatins(@attribute,'value')

conatins(text(),'some part of the text')
