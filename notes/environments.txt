In any project for any application there will be different environments available

such as like
QA
UAT
Staging
Prod

QA: this is the environment where we do testing (testing team,r,w)
UAT: business users use this environment for their testing(testing team,r,w)
Staging: it is the replica of production(testing team,r,w)
Prod: actual users use this evironment(testing team,r)

for each one of this environment wil have a unique url to launch the application
how are we going to making the launch Application method to open application in the respective environment

there are two ways to do this
1.creating custom json config
2.using playwright environment config
